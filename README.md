# Dynamic Routing Protocol Comparisons

As part of my International Baccaulaureate Diploma, I wrote a paper analyzing the perfomance differences between the RIP and OSPF dynamic routing protocols. To do this, I wrote a simulation to compare the Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford path-finding algorithms. You can see the results in the [paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yxtjrsfnbdpj#02f276).
